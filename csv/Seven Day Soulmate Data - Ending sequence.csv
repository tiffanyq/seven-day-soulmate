Person,Dialogue
Riley,"It's been seven days. It’s time for you to pick one of us, once and for all. So, tell us…who will it be?"
(you pick),
You,"Wait, really? Do I really have to pick a soulmate in just seven days?"
Riley,I mean…it’s really been much longer than seven days…
Robin,"So, which future self do you like best? Do you want to make art or what?"
River,"Yeah, pick one of us, Robbie! Move to New York!!"
Rory,Slow down and care more about the people around you.
Ronnie,Your tennis career could just be getting started!!
Riley,"Actually, I feel like you should target a work promotion!"
You,"Even after dating all these different potential versions of myself, I don’t think I can commit to a single life path forever!"
Riley,"I get that…but I think you should commit to one of us future selves, even if it’s just for now."
Riley,"Robbie, you've been so indecisive about what you want in life. You want it all: doubling down on your career. Pursuing your passions. Exploring the world. Being better to the people around you. Exploring all the “what ifs” you’ve accumulated over time. You’ve been feeling stuck, and I thought you might get unstuck by finally committing to a direction."
Riley,"You're right. You don’t have to commit to a single path forever. I’m sorry for putting that pressure on you. But you've been thinking about all these future selves for years now without taking action, and I think...maybe it would help if you picked one of us, just for now?"
Robin,"The direction you choose doesn't have to be for a lifetime, and yet we'll all be together for a lifetime. Isn't that beautiful?"
River,And terrifying!
Rory,We'll always be here for you!
Ronnie,You'll always wonder what could've happened if you won that one tournament in middle school!
Riley,"So, for the next few months, or until it's time to move on...who will you be?"
(you pick),
