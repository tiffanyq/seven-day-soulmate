Riley,"It's been a week. It's time to pick one of us, once and for all. So who will it be?"
(you pick),
You,"Wait, really? Do I really have to pick one person for my entire lifetime? How am I supposed to identify my soulmate in seven days?"
Riley,Well...
Robin,Riley...
River,You're stressing Robbie out.
Riley,"Okay, I'm sorry. "
Riley,"Look, Robbie, you've been so indecisive recently about what you want in life. I just wanted to encourage you to commit to some direction. You're right, it doesn't have to be for a lifetime. I'm sorry for pressuring you to think that far into the future. But you've been circling through all of us for years now, and I think...maybe it would help if you picked one of us, just for now?"
Robin,"The direction you choose doesn't have to be for a lifetime, and yet we'll all be together for a lifetime. Isn't that beautiful?"
River,And terrifying!
Rory,We'll always be here for you!
Ronnie,You'll always wonder what could've happened if you won that one tournament in elementary school!
Riley,"So, for the next few months, or until it's time to move on...who will it be?"
